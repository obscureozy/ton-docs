# Vesting recipient guide

As a vesting recipient, you receive funds from a vesting wallet based on the set schedule. This guide walks you through the process of verifying transactions and withdrawing funds.

## Step-by-step instructions

### 1: Create a recipient wallet

- Set up a regular TON wallet using [MyTonWallet](https://mytonwallet.io/) or [Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/) wallet.
- Safely store your seed phrase, as it controls all your tokens.
- Get some Testnet coins from [@testgiver_ton_bot](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot)

### 2: Activate the recipient's wallet

- Send **0.1 TON** to any address to activate the address.

### 3: Request the vesting address

- Use MyTonWallet, Tonkeeper, or any TON Connect-supported wallet.
- Request the vesting wallet address from the owner.  

### 4: Verify your address

- Visit the vesting wallet on  [TON Viewer](https://testnet.tonviewer.com) or [TON Scan](https://testnet.tonscan.org).
- Confirm your address appears in the whitelist.

### 5: Test transaction

- Send a small test transaction to the vesting wallet.
- Confirm the transaction through your wallet.

## Good to Know

- Only whitelisted addresses can receive funds from the Vesting Wallet.
- Ensure your address is in bounceable format to avoid **Exit 101** errors.
- Use [@tonaddress_bot](https://t.me/tonaddress_bot) for address format checks.
- Always double-check the vesting wallet details on official explorers like [TON Viewer](https://testnet.tonviewer.com) or  [TON Scan](https://testnet.tonscan.org).
